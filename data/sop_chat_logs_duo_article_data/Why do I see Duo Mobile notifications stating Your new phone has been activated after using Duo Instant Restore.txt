Why do I see Duo Mobile notifications stating "Your new phone has been activated" after using Duo Instant Restore?

ANSWER
After setting up a new phone using Duo Instant Restore, you will receive a notification from Duo Mobile on your old device saying "Your new phone has been activated". 

Read more about the process of recovering Duo-protected accounts with Instant Restore in Duo's guide to Duo Restore.

Seeing this notification multiple times indicates that you restored multiple Duo-protected accounts in Duo Mobile via the Instant Restore mechanism. You will see one notification per account.

If you are an end-user who received this message and you did not reactivate your device, please reach out to your organization's Help Desk.
