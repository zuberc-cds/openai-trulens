Why am I locked out of my Duo-protected applications for work or school after formatting or restoring my phone?

ANSWER

Note: This article applies to Duo-protected applications that you access for work, school, or an organization. For information on the differences between third-party accounts and Duo-protected applications, please see this article: What are the differences between Duo-protected applications and third-party accounts?. If you are locked out of a third-party account after formatting or restoring your device, please see this article: Why am I locked out of my third-party accounts (such as Instagram or Facebook) in Duo Mobile after formatting or restoring my phone?


When you format your Android device or restore your iOS device, Duo Mobile is automatically deleted from your phone, disconnecting the Duo Mobile app from your device. If you enabled Duo Restore, you can use your recovery password to reconnect Duo Mobile to your Duo-protected applications when you reinstall the Duo Mobile app.

If you do not have the recovery password for Duo Restore, contact your IT help desk or Duo administrator to regain access to your Duo-protected professional or educational applications and accounts.
