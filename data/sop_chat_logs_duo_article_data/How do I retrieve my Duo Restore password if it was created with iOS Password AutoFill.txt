How do I retrieve my Duo Restore password if it was created with iOS Password AutoFill

ANSWER
If you used the iOS Password AutoFill feature to create a password while setting up Duo Restore, and you need to retrieve this password, go to Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Website & App Passwords in your iOS device and tap Duo Mobile to view the generated password.

You have the option to modify the generated password at this location. Your new password will not be valid if modified this way.

If you wish to modify your Duo Restore password, please disable Duo Restore within Duo Mobile, then enable it again. You will be prompted to set a new password when you re-enable it.
