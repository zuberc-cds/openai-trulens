Why am I locked out of my third-party accounts (such as Instagram or Facebook) in Duo Mobile after formatting or restoring my phone?

ANSWER
Note: This article applies to third-party accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat. For information on the differences between third-party accounts and Duo-protected applications, please see this article: What are the differences between Duo-protected applications and third-party accounts?. If you are locked out of a Duo-protected application that you use for work or school after formatting or restoring your device, please see this article: Why am I locked out of my Duo-protected applications for work or school after formatting or restoring my phone?


When you format your Android device or restore your iOS device, Duo Mobile is automatically deleted from your phone, disconnecting the Duo Mobile app from your third-party accounts (Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc.). If you enabled Duo Restore, you can use your recovery password to reconnect your third-party accounts when you reinstall the Duo Mobile app. See instructions for recovering third-party accounts on iOS and Android.


If you do not have the recovery password for Duo Restore, please see this article for instructions on regaining access to your third-party accounts: What do I do if Iâ€™m locked out of Instagram, Facebook, or another third-party Duo Mobile account?
