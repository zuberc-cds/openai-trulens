How do I identify and remove duplicate accounts restored from a previous Duo Mobile backup

ISSUE
Duplicate accounts exist in Duo Mobile after using Duo Restore to reactivate and restore Duo-protected accounts.
RESOLUTION
Since one of the accounts has been restored from an old backup and superseded by the new account, only one will be functional.

To identify and delete the non-functional account:
Test each account by logging in to a Duo-protected application with the Duo Mobile generated passcode. You will not be able to successfully log in to a protected application using a Duo Mobile passcode from the older, non-functional account.
Once the non-functional account has been identified, you can manually delete it from Duo Mobile.
CAUSE
Duo Mobile activations are device-specific. Enabling Duo Restore after activating Duo Mobile will fetch previous device backups. These old accounts will show up as deactivated entries in Duo Mobile.
