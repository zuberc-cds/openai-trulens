The notification "Account Backups Disabled" in the Duo Mobile application indicates Duo Restore has not been enabled by an end-user in Duo Mobile on their Android device.

Duo Restore for the Duo Mobile app gives end-users the ability to back up and restore non-sensitive Duo account information from the Duo Mobile app to Google Drive (Android devices) or iCloud (iOS devices).

Regardless of whether Duo Mobile Restore or Instant Restore are enabled in the Duo Admin Panel Settings by a Duo administrator, end-users can still see this message and enable Duo Restore locally, to back up non-sensitive info for Duo User Accounts and third-party accounts (account names and icons only), but they would not be able to back up the full, Duo-Protected account if the setting is not enabled in the Duo Admin Panel. 

This message cannot be suppressed by Administrator settings and will continue to serve as a reminder if a user does not have Duo Restore enabled in Duo Mobile for Android only.
