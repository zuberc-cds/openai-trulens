Why am I seeing "Account Disabled" in the Duo Mobile account list?

ANSWER
Users will see “Account Disabled” in their Duo Mobile account list when their account name was restored but not reconnected through Duo Restore. This can be for Duo-protected accounts or third-party accounts. For third-party accounts, this means that the account must be reconnected in order to generate one-time passcodes (OTPs). For Duo-protected accounts, this means that the account must be reconnected to be used for authenticating via Duo Push or passcodes. Read more about Duo Restore in our end-user guide.
