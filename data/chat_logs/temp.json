Try accessing the internet from another device (e.g., a colleague's computer) to see if the problem persists.\nCheck your network: Check to see if you are connected to the \"CDS\" network. If you are WFH try using a different network/Internet service provider. (eg. If you are using JIO, switch to Airtel or Vodafone network)\nRestart Your Device: Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve connectivity issues. Reboot your computer or device and check if the internet speed improves.\nCheck for Software Updates: Ensure that your operating system and applications are up to date. Sometimes, outdated software can cause connectivity issues."

This will help you determine the actual speed of your internet connection.\n\nCheck for Background Processes: Make sure that no bandwidth-intensive applications or downloads are running in the background. Close unnecessary programs and browser tabs.\n\nClear Browser Cache: Clear your browser's cache and cookies, as a cluttered cache can affect internet speed.\n\nCheck for Software Updates: Ensure that your operating system and applications are up to date. Sometimes, outdated software can cause connectivity issues.\n\nDisconnect from the VPN: Disconnect from the VPN if you are connected to one to see if the speed improves. (For Example: Disconnect Zscaler and Global Protect if you are using a Splunk Device)\n\nIf you are facing Internet slowness after connecting to Splunk Global Protect VPN. We identified that there is an issue with Splunk tunnel and advising to use Splunk's Split tunnel. Splunk team suggested to remove the preferred network (remove star showing on currently available tunnel) and once star is removed, click on the best available gateway, so it would connect to split tunnel automatically and give good internet speed and surfing from Splunk systems.\n\nSplit tunnel name is APAC SIN2 Split Tunnel\n\nWhen using and enabling Zscaler, you can check your Internet Speed by visiting http://speedtest.zscaler.com/perf and verify the Zscaler data center by visiting https://ip.zscaler.com/. could not get a proper speed on this URL: http://speedtest.zscaler.com/perf. Please exit the Zscaler client and open a  new tab or page to check your surfing and speed on online tools like Speedtest.net.\n"
